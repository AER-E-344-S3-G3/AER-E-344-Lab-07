\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cp:conclusion}

To analyze the flow patterns downstream of an airfoil, we measured the velocity profile downstream of the airfoil using a hot wire anemometer. Due to erroneous data collected from the hot wire anemometer or a misconfiguration of the hot wire anemometer, we were unable to generate a conclusive analysis of the wake region. To rectify this and generate proper results, we would thoroughly review the \acrshort{matlab} analysis script and, if necessary, validate the functionality and accuracy of the hot wire anemometer before repeating the experiment.
