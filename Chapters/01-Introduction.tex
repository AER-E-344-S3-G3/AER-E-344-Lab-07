The hot-wire anemometer uses a thin wire that passes electric current through it to maintain a constant temperature. As flow passes over the wire, voltage loss is recorded, enabling the anemometer to determine the velocity of the flow. In this experiment, the anemometer is used to track the velocity of flow at various points in the flow behind an airfoil. 

Using voltage measurements from the hot-wire anemometer, we will create a profile of the airfoil wake region. We will calculate the coefficient of drag, and compare this to the calculations done for Lab 5 and Lab 6. We will also estimate the boundary layer thickness for the airfoil wake region profiles, and compare these with theoretical values.
